This extension was developed largely in response to the lack of snippets for Ada. Not just the lack for VS Code, but a lack in general.

# Features

* Snippets covering Ada features, not just features common to most programming languages.
    * Variant records
	* Task types
	* ...
* Dropdown completion where possible
    * Aspect snippet lists all valid aspects under GNAT
	* Record snippet lists all record types
	* ...
* Snippets for AdaCore's GPR format

# Works Best With
* [Ada-vscode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Entomy.ada) To provide Ada syntax highlighting, although this isn't required for functionality.

# Special Thanks
* Jeremiah Breeden: Considerable contributions to quality assurance
